# Guess_the_Place

Guess the Place is a simple and fun geography game which also serves educational purposes.
During the game a player needs to point out to the place which is shown in the photography. If the pointed location is close enough to the actual location of the place, he proceeds to the next level. There are 10 levels in total and each game takes about 2-3 minutes. On top of that there is a scoring system - the closer to the actual location the player points to, the more points he gets. As the game proceeds to the higher levels, more obscure locations appear and the distance threshold becomes smaller. After each level the actual location of the place is revealed and the excerpt from the place's Wikipedia article is loaded to the screen.
There is also a scoreboard, but as of now it works only locally.
